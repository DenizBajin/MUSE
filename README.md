### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```

### Step 2: Open the File

Drag and drop the intro.html file into any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Step 3: Generate Music
1: Select one of the large circles.

2: Click one of the colors from the palette. Sound will play.

3: Click on the other large circle and select a color. This will play that sound on top of the one you are already playing.

4: Use the sliders to adjust the sound and the color of the selected large circle.

5: When ready, click "save mixture" to save your new color.

####Where did my saved colors go?

You can keep playing the sounds that you saved by clicking the saved colors menu and clicking the color you want to keep playing, mixing, and editing.

####Can I edit multiple colors at a time?

Unless multiple colors are mixed and saved as one color, you can only adjust and edit one color. The color you will be editing is the one that you clicked last which will display a gray circle around it.
